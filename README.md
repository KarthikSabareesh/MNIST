# MNIST
One of my first TensorFlow programs, a classification neural network for an MNIST dataset

## Processes involved
1) Importing required libraries
2) Importing MNIST dataset
3) Performing preprocessing operations (rescaling, normalising and one hot encoding)
4) Defining callback (ModelCheckpoint)
5) Building and compiling model
6) Fitting model on training data and loading best model weights 9from callback)
7) making predictions and evaluating how accurate our model was

   This was a basic model I designed in my beginning stages with TensorFlow for a common yet still important usecase in the world of ML and neural networks
